I'm in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death? well that's ridiculous
I'm a live forever cause a legend never die
See the world assemble but complex in the design
I spent some time just thinkin'
Where did that get me?
High, more drinkin'
Now my head empty
So can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checking bitches off my hit list
Try and understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world's a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal is a loaded gun
And I'm a shoot somebody in the face if they're too slow to run
Mac Miller I'm the only one
But I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium
My middle finger up with a cup
And a dutch spliff, hand on my nuts
While I'm wild and out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America Still in a room filled with holographic images
Crushing information into powder then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
Iller than the future death of you ingestin' sudafed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress
See this is what I do the best
Nothing that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a brave heart, a warrior
I take caution, stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my using dope
Talkin' all that shit sounds exactly like a groupie hoe
Most dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio
First you lose you mind then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? thinkin' you're out of options
American border, pipper but formal, above and beyond, Medal of Honor
My middle finger up with a cup
And a dutch spliff, hand on my nuts
While I'm wild and out, public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America Yo chick live in Pittsburg? bet I steal her,
Shout out my wigga Mac Miller
Comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa,
With a girl that know what the deal is,
Yea they know I come from the illest
City on a map, we don't know how to act
Realest young rap, go getters in America
Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go
CV and Mac meezy takin' off on PJ's
We the future so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat
Wake up, shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drop cast for the deal, Veggies
My middle finger up with a cup
And a dutch spliff, hand on my nuts
While I'm wild and out, public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America
