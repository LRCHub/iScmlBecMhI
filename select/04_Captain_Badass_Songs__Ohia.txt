Departure and worry
And worry, and worry
Still shake me
Resistance failed
Resistance failed
And friendship failed
And friendship failed
As lovers we did not fail
As lovers we did not fail
Brown eyes your pulse is getting hotter
Brown eyes your pulse is getting quicker
Quote Captain Badass,
"I am setting your heart on fire
So when you leave me
I will burn on in your soul"
You won't have to think twice
If it's love you will know
We get no second chance in this life
We get no second chance in this life
So a hot pulse is alright
So a quick pulse is alright
So a hot kiss is alright
So a long kiss is alright
So a long night is alright
And all night is alright
There ain't no contest
Against the final day
We'll rise above us either way
We're either greeted
By life or it's reverse
Then each day greeted
By fortune or it's reverse
Will you stand up for your one chance
Will you stand up for love
We get no second chance in this life
We get no second chance in this life
You won't have to think twice if it's love
You will know
