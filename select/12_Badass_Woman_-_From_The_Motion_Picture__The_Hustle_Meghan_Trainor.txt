I'm a badass woman
What's wrong with that?
Can't hold me back
Yeah, I'm a badass woman
Just made like that
But I'm proud of that
'Cause I'm a badass woman
Never second guess me
'Cause, baby, I'm the boss
Don't underestimate me
'Cause I'm the one in charge
I am smarter than you give me credit for
And I'm way stronger than I ever been before
I'm a force of nature that you can't ignore
You can't ignore, you can't ignore no more
I'm a badass woman
What's wrong with that?
Can't hold me back

For saying what's on my mind (on my mind)
And I don't need a body
To prove I'm worth your time (time)
