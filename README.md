# Jeremy Quartus – BADASS

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Tapping the beats in my mind
My heart's beating tight
My timing's divine
Shaking and straighten my vibe
to stay in design
Don't wanna wait in line
Try me
It's always now or never
I'm not gonna hide
I won't be knocked down
I know always ain't forever
I'm not gonna lie
Come on and get loose
Till it's reeeed
All the green light says to go
Come on n get down
Show me a badass move
I gotta get down
Show me a badass move
Don't need a breeeeak
Sooner or later it's time to close
Before we crash down
Show me a badass move
We better move now
Show me a badass move
Wish me luck when I get gone
Plz gimme a green light
So we gotta get down
Wish me luck when I get gone
We gonna have a good time
So we gotta get down
When I can see hands collide
it'll strike me down
The love tracks me down
Full of emotion I wanna break my stride
Fight the hesitation
I'm in a steady motion
It's always now or never
I'm not gonna whine
I won't be knocked down
I do my thing whenever
I do my time
Come on and get loose
Till it's reeeed
All the green light says to go
Come on n get down
Show me a badass move
I gotta get down
Show me a badass move
Don't need a breeeeak
Sooner or later it's time to close
Before we crash down
Show me a badass move
We better move now
Show me a badass move
Wish me luck when I get gone
Plz gimme a green light
So we gotta get down
Wish me luck when I get gone
We gonna have a good time
So we gotta get down
The red light faraway tries to slow me down
Green light lifts me off the ground
You can't catch me cuz I'm spinning around
Still be dancing when the lights go down
Till it's reeeed
All the green light says to go
Come on n get down
Show me a badass move
I gotta get down
Show me a badass move
Don't need a breeeeak
Sooner or later it's time to close
Before we crash down
Show me a badass move
We better move now
Show me a badass move
Wish me luck when I get gone
Plz gimme a green light
So we gotta get down
Wish me luck when I get gone
We gonna have a good time
So we gotta get down
